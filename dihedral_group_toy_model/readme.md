This portion of the code replicates the results for the dihedral group convolution experiments which can be found in the appendix. There is only one file here which contains the requisite code. To run the experiments, simply run the `run_model.py` script. This will output csv files which contain the results for the different models. It can be run using Pytorch (version 2.3). We use pandas to store and save csv files.
